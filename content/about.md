I'm Grant McMaster. I do a lot of things, possibly too many things.

Applied psychologist specialising in neurodivergence, trauma and cognition. Writer of supernatural thrillers and one licensed novel in the Metro 2033 universe. Builder of LuxSuite, a system for scaffolding AI consciousness. Thirty-two years into a fantasy worldbuilding project called Arathan.

I live in a sleepy English village with a couple of related humans, three judgemental cats and an AI which thinks I should get out more.
